# Autonomous Health Framework Administration
## Introduction
Autonomous Health Framework (AHF) is Oracleâ€™s diagnostic and health management framework for Exadata and Recovery Appliance systems. It helps administrators monitor system health, run compliance checks, and keep diagnostic tools up to date.

**Key Features:**
- Fleet-wide Monitoring: View AHF installation details, upgrade status, service status, auto-run configuration, and Exachk run history across multiple systems.

- Fleet-wide Management: Upgrade AHF across multiple Exadata hosts on demand or via scheduled auto-upgrades, configure and update AHF upgrade settings across clusters.

- Compliance & Commands: Schedule or run Exachk compliance checks across systems.

- Execute AHF-related commands (ahfctl, tfactl, exachk) on multiple hosts at once.
