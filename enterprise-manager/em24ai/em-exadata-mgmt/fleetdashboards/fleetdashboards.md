# Exadata Fleet Dashboards
## Introduction
Exadata Fleet Dashboards provide a unified, high-level view of resource usage, capacity, and performance across an entire fleet of Exadata systems. They enable administrators to quickly identify systems that need attention, analyze component-level usage, and track metric trends, supporting proactive management of both on-premises and cloud-based Exadata and Recovery Appliance environments.

### Objectives
To enable users to efficiently navigate and utilize the Exadata Fleet Configuration Dashboards within Oracle Enterprise Manager, they can
- Gain a high-level overview of resource usage across the fleet
- Identify Exadata systems that require attention
- Analyze usage of individual components within an Exadata system (by consulting the Exadata Fleet Component Capacity dashboard)
- Review and analyze metric trends

## Task 1: Explore Fleet Configuration Dashboard

Exadata Fleet Configuration dashboard shows the Exadata hardware and software configurations across the Exadata and Recovery Appliance fleet, based on the last known metric collection. You can apply the filters to limit the display to a subset of systems.
